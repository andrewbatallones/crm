# CRM Server
This will be a very basic implementation of a CRM. As I build more of it out, 
I want to get a finished product up (for people to download and use).
I'll be documenting as much as I can in terms of what technologies I'll use as well as hopefully
a better understanding of Java.

Required Stuff
- Teams (an account can manage multiple sales teams)
- Employees
  - Manager
- Users
  - Owner
- Customers
  - Addresses
  - Notes
- Products
- Orders
  - shipping address
  - billing address
  - notes

Extra stuff if I can finish the simple stuff
- Integration with ecommerce sites (Bigcommerce, Shopify)
  - Basically will be able to sync customers / orders
  - Maybe products? (but now that is getting to another app - product management, which may be a good second project).
